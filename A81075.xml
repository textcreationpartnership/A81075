            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Second Conſideration was, that having already publiſhed a Book of the ſame value of the Kings of England, and two or three other little Tracts of the moſt conſiderable Occurrences and Rarities in that Countray, I could not but think it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, to give ſome particular account of what has happened in former Ages in the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wherein I aim at plainneſs and brevity, yet have omitted nothing material, to far as it was poſſible to reduce ſo many notable Paſſages into ſo ſmall a compaſs, which I doubt not but you will acknowledge upon peruſeing thereof.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE Kingdom of SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Scots</hi> (as well as other Nations) eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it glorious to derive themſelves from far-fetcht Antiquity, affirm, their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Deſcent to be from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and their ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians relate that a noble <hi>Greek</hi> called <hi>Gathelus</hi> (the ſon of <hi>Cecrops</hi> who built the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> others ſay, the ſen of <hi>Argus</hi> the 4th King of the <hi>Argives</hi>) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers outrages in <hi>Macedonia and Achaia,</hi> was often ſeverely reprehended by his Father; but the young man impatient of reproof, and continuing his irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, was baniſhed. In his Exile, conſorting with ſeveral ſtout youths of the ſame humor, they went all into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were entertained by <hi>Pharaoh Orus</hi> then King of that Countrey, imploying them under <hi>Moſes</hi> the Captain General againſt the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> who had invaded <hi>Egypt</hi> as far as <hi>Memphis; Gathelus</hi> marched under <hi>Moſes,</hi> who (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reporteth) was choſen Commander in chief by the voice of an Oracle, and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> received a great overthrow, with the loſs of <hi>Saba</hi> their principal City in the Iſle of <hi>Merot.</hi> In this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connter as well as many others, <hi>Gathelus</hi> gave ſuch proof of his conduct and courage, that he became much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172233:5"/>in favour with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> was rather envied then honoured for his valour, the King fearing that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> increaſing ſo extreamly, might one day chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the government of he Kingdom; whereupon <hi>Moſes</hi> went into the land of <hi>Midian;</hi> But to <hi>Gathelus</hi> and his followers the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> was given, which had been formerly the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and to add to his honour <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gave him his daughter in marriage, whoſe name you muſt know was <hi>Scota,</hi> of whoſe Poſterity it ſeems came the <hi>Scoti,</hi> or the Nation of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the land where they inhabited was called <hi>Scotia</hi> or <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gathelus</hi> thus advanced, lived all the days of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law-in great ſplendor, but after the third Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration another <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called <hi>Cheucres</hi> ſucceeded, who oppreſſed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> more then his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, till <hi>Moſes</hi> by divine appointment returning from <hi>Midian</hi> declared God's will that he ſhould let go the people, which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> refuſing was horribly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and more ſevere Judgments threatmed; <hi>Gathelus</hi> believing the Oracle, reſolved to forſake this miſerable Countrey, and providing a great number of Ships, he with Wife and Children, and a multitude of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſailed out of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> in the year of the World 2453. having dwelt in <hi>Egypt</hi> 39. years; after many dangers at Sea, they firſt toucht upon the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary</hi> from whence being beaten back by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants they imbarqued again, and landed in a part of <hi>Spain</hi> called <hi>Luſitania,</hi> and called the place where they went aſhore <hi>Port Gathale,</hi> of this <hi>Gathelus,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by corruption <hi>Portugal,</hi> as at this day; when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> underſtood their Arrival, they came againſt them with ſtrong Forces, but after a bloody Fight were routed by <hi>Gathelus,</hi> which much incouraged him and his followers; ſoon after it was agreed that they ſhould continue there, and <hi>Gathlus</hi> built a City called <hi>Mundus</hi> and after <hi>Bacchara;</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceiving theſe ſtrangers mightily increaſe, deſigned to have forced them away, yet doubting their ſtrength, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172233:5"/>propoſed to <hi>Gathelus</hi> to temove to the North ſide of <hi>Spain,</hi> now called <hi>Galicia,</hi> as being thinly peopled; which he willingly accepted and ſacrificing publickly to his Gods for his good ſucceſs, departed thither with all his People, and making a League with the Natives, built a City called <hi>Brigantia,</hi> now <hi>Gompoſteila;</hi> Being thus ſetled, <hi>Gathelus</hi> was called King, and ordrined good Laws, and becauſe he would have all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers under one Government he commanded they ſhould be called <hi>Scotsmen,</hi> from his wife <hi>Scota.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In proceſs of time growing very populous; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reſolved to root them out, but after a ſharp Fight, the <hi>Scots</hi> remained Conquerors, upon which a peace fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and it was agreed they ſhould live after their own Laws, and not be diſturbed; <hi>Gathelus</hi> thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, (ſaith our Hiſtoria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Gathelus</hi> obſerved that the Countrey was too little for them, reſolving to maintain the League inviolate with <hi>Spain,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding there was an Iſland North of <hi>Spain</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited, he ſent his two ſons <hi>Hyberus</hi> and <hi>Himericus</hi> with a great Navy, and a ſtrong Army, who landed at <hi>Dundal</hi> in that Country, and called it <hi>Hybernia</hi> from the eldeſt ſon's name now <hi>Ireland;</hi> being arrived they found the Inhabitants to be few, and ſimple, living on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Milk, Herbs, and other Fruits growing naturally; hereupon they treated them gently, and eaſily perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to ſubmit and join in friendſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hyberus</hi> having taught them tillage and huſbandry, returned into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſucceeded his Father <hi>Gathelus,</hi> ſubduing more of that Countrey, the ſucceſſion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in his Poſterity a long while after. <hi>Himericus</hi> was left by his brother to govern <hi>Ireland;</hi> ruling both the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172233:6"/>
               <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but in time great differences aroſe, and much blood was ſhed, till at length by aſſiſtance from <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſubdued, and the <hi>Scots</hi> ſetled there, who crowned one <hi>Brechus</hi> of the Blood royal King, being the firſt that Reigned over <hi>Scotchmen</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> to him Succeeded others, and at length one <hi>Rothſay,</hi> who obſerving <hi>Ireland</hi> to be too narrow he transported a great number into the Iſles formerly called <hi>Hebrides,</hi> now the Weſtern Iſles, and gave his name to that which he firſt poſſeſt; from the Iſles they went over all that Countrey, which they then named <hi>Scotland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing many years in great Glory under good Laws and Governours.</p>

            <p>About this time, ſaith my Author, there dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Picts</hi> one <hi>Valdrid</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who converted them to the Faith; after his death three Pariſhes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about the burying his body, with ſuch heat as they were ready to fight, but by advice it was ordered, that they ſhould continue in Prayers all that night, and the next morning ſtand to the Biſhops determination,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172233:17"/>next day there were found three Coffins with three Bodies decently covered with Cloth, ſo much alike that none could diſtinguiſh them aſunder; then by the command of the Biſhop, and with great Joy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Bodies were carried to the three ſeveral Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and there Solemnly buried, where they remain to this day, ſaith my Author, in great veneration with the common people.</p>
            <p n="11">XI.

               <hi>Eugenius</hi> forgot not the Virtuous inſtructions of St. <hi>Colme</hi> in his Youth, ſo that he rather ſtudied quietly to preſerve what he had than to inlarge his Dominions, he was extreamly beloved being impartial in the execution of Juſtice, ſparing none in regard of Nobility or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but was rather more ſtrict againſt the diſorders of

            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> kindly entertained the Sons of <hi>Etheldred,</hi> though their Father had been a cruel Enemy to the <hi>Scots,</hi> who after they had continued a while in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Devour Exhortations of the Biſhops and Monks forſook Idolatry and imbraced Chriſtiany. <hi>Eugenius</hi> died leaving three Sons behind him, <hi>Ferquard, Fiacre.</hi> and <hi>Donald,</hi> who were all by their Fathers appointment educated in Virtue by <hi>Conon</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Man, Ferquad</hi> and <hi>Donald</hi> did not much regard his Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Judging them not to agree with their Birth and Degree, but <hi>Fiacre</hi> heard him gladly reſolving to forſake the VVorld, and retire to a Contemplative Life.</p>

Upon his Death-bed he adviſed his Nobility. 1. Not to make an abſolute Lord over the Iſles, leſt it might incourage Rebellion, which would not be eaſy to quell by reaſon of difficulty of approach, they being incompaſt by the Sea. 2. Never if poſſible to join in a ſet Battle againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor venture the Kingdom upon the chance of one Fight, but rather to ſkirmiſh at advantage, that ſome reſerve might remain. 3. Not to make any long Peace or Truce with <hi>England,</hi> ſince Idleneſs cauſed ſloth and Cowardize. He deſired his Heart might be carried to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> whither he had deſigned to have gone, which was undertaken by Sir <hi>James Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> who had therefore the Bloody Heart in his Arms; but he by the way aſſiſting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Arragon</hi> was cut off with all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

It happened that a Countrey Clown, hid his own plough Irons, and pretended they were ſtolen, thereby to recover the value from the Sheriff, but the cheat being diſcovered, he was Hang'd according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> envying the flouriſhing ſtate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſent a Monk who poiſoned the Governor, in the mean invaded the Borders, but it ſeems he venom was of ſuch a nature as not to kill ſuddenly, ſo that though he were ſo ſick, as not able to ride nor go, yet he cauſed himſelf to be carried into the Field, in an Horſe litter, in the head of a conſiderable Army, which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, <hi>Edward</hi> ſent an Herald, pretending to treat him, but really to obſerve the poſture of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Camp.

            <p n="59">LIX. <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> after this great Victory finding the Nobility and Commons coming in great numbers to his aſſiſtance, cauſed himſelf to be Crowned King in 1332.

Complaints were made againſt Mordack late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, his Wife and Sons, with other Peers, for high miſdemeanors before the Kings Return, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon with the Earl of Dowglaſs, Angus, March and others; James Stewart the Third Son of Mordack, in revenge of his Father's, Mother's and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's Impriſonment, burnt the Town of Dunbrittain, and fled to Ireland, where he died; next Year Duke Mordack with Walter and Alexander Stewart his Sons
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:172233:68"/>were Condemned in a Parliament at Sterling, and all three beheaded, whereby the Earldoms of Fife, Monteith, and Lennox came into the Kings hands, and the reſt of the Impriſoned Lords were reſtored to Liberty and Favour; Donald of the Iſles at this time did much miſchief, but being purſued, fled into Ireland, where he was beheaded by one Odo, and his head ſent to the King for a preſent; three hundred of his Fellows were in Ten Days taken and Hang'd.</p>
            <p>King James then made a Progreſs through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to puniſh Offenders, allowing no pardon of the Governour's granted for Murders, Felonies and other Villanies not pardonable by the Law of God; ſo that in his firſt two years three Thouſand Perſons were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for their former Crimes; notwithſtanding which one Agnus Duffe with a Crew of Thieves and Robbers, took away goods out of Murray and Cathnes, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which one Agnus Murray purſued him with ſtrong Forces, who made ſuch reſiſtance that there remained only two perſons alive of both Parties, which conſiſted of many hundreds.

            <p>Next year the Queen was delivered of two Sons at a Birth, named Alexander and James; the ſame year happened a dreadful Eclipſe of the Sun, ſo that for half an hour it was as dark as midnight, which was after called the Black Hour; ſoon after the King beſieged the Caſtle of Roxborough, but was forc'd to leave it ſtill in the hands of the Engliſh; the Lord

            <p>Hereupon King James raiſed a great Army, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain beſieged Roxborough, which when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to terms of ſurrendring the Queen arrived in great haſte in the Camp, aſſuring the King there was a dreadful Conſpiracy againſt his Life; whereupon he inſtantly raiſed the Seige to provide for his ſafety, but it was paſt remedy, for Walter Stewart, Earl of Athol, was the principal Conſpirator, alledging that he was the true Heir to the Crown, being deſcended from Robert the ſecond by his 1.

            <p>Hereupon they hanged Thomas Cockrain, William Rogers, and James Hominil a Taylor, over the Bridge at Lowder, ſaving John Ramſey a Youth of eighteen, at the Kings earneſt deſire, and committing the King to Edenburgh Caſtle, they concluded a Truce with the Engliſh, whereby the Duke of Albany was reſtored to his Country, Eſtate, and Honour; and ſo the Engliſh returned home having taken the Caſtle of Berwick in their march into Scotland.

If they be out of the way let us bring them in; if they be in darkneſs let us give them light, not kill, baniſh &amp; burn thoſe whom by love and ſweetneſs we might reduce and recal again.

James the Sixth, not above two years Old, was then Crowned at Sterling, by Commiſſion from the Queen his Mother, who reſigned the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Earl of Murray was choſen Regent during his Minority with power to aſſociate ſeven others to his aſſiſtance, namely the Duke of Caſtleherault, and the Earls of Lennox. Argile, Athol, Morton, Glencarn and Mar; and a Parliament being called an Act was made for aboliſhing the Popes Authority in Scotland; May 2. the Queen eſcaped out of Locklevyn, where ſhe was kept by the Regent and the Lords, and with the aſſiſtance of George Dowglaſs and others was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Hammilton Caſtle, where ſhe raiſed Forces; the Regent upon the News got his Friends together, and within two miles of Glaſgow a Battle was fought, wherein the Queens Party was diſcomfited, fourteen of the name of Hamilton being ſlain; three hundred taken priſoners, and among them ſeveral Lords; the Queen perceiving from the place where ſhe ſtood, the overthrow of her Forces, withdrew into Galloway, and from thence by the Sea to Workington in England, where ſhe was ſtayed by Sir Ralph Sadler, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>In 1569 the Earls of Northumberland and Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land raiſed a Rebellion againſt Queen Elizabeth, and burned the Bible, but being ſuppreſt by the diligence of the Earl of Suſſex, and other Gallant Captains, they fled into Scotland; ſoon after the Regent riding through Lithgow was ſhot to death with an Harquebuz by one James Hammilton; after this Murther, the Lords ſent for the Earl of Lennox out of England, who came to Edenburgh with ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen, and reduced the Earl of Huntley and other Lords that oppoſed him, and was by the Parliament made Regent of the Kingdom; The Queens Lords again raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forces; and fortified ſeveral places, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Regent were defeated in ſeveral ſkirmiſhes; but at length three hundred entring one morning early in the Regents Houſe at Sterling, wounded him with a Piſtol, of which he died, and the Lords choſe the Earl of Mar Regent in his ſtead, who Thirteen Months after died, and the Earl of Morton ſucceeded, at which time the Duke of Norfolk was Beheaded upon Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, for High Treaſon, and among other Articles, for deſigning to Marry the Queen of Scots; Ten days after Commiſſioners were ſent to Queen Mary, charging her for uſurping the Tittle and Arms of England, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to Marry the Duke of Norfolk, to which ſhe anſwered in the Negative; the Earl of Northnmberland had wandred in the Woods of Scotland ſince his laſt Rebellion and was ſecured from being delivered up by Murray, but now Morton ſells him to the Governour of Berwick and he was ſoon after Beheaded at York, The Realm was now divided between two Factions, The King and the Reformers, and the Queen and her Lords who kept the Caſtle of Edenburgh, but by aſſiſtance from England the Regent gained it; now ſeveral differences

            <p>The Earl of Morton late Regent is about this time accuſed for the Murther of the late K. which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt before he died, excuſing it, as being forced thereto by the diſturbances of that time; the Fatal Ax, called the Maiden, which he had cauſed to be made by a pattern at Hallifax in Yorkſhire, falling down between two Poſts, was now the Inſtrument of his own Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The Earls of Mar and Gowry, the Lords, Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, Boyd, with two Abbots, and others ſeized the K at Ruthen, from whom he after freed himſelf, for being in Falkland, he deſired to Viſit his Uncle the Earl of March at Saint Andrews, where taking a View of the Caſtle, Colonel Stuart acquainted of the deſign, clapt to the Gates, and ſhut out the company, and next day the Earls of Argile, Marſhal, Montroſs and Rothes, the Kings Friends came thither to him, and to prevent further miſchiefs the K Pardoned thoſe Lords who had been his formes Keepers; but Earl Gowry was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and Executed; and the Earl of Arran was made Lord Chancellor.</p>
            <p>In 1586 Mary Queen of Scots was brought to a Trial at Fotheringay Caſtle in Northamptonſhire before Twenty four Commiſſioners, whoſe Authority ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned as being a free Princeſs, yet being charged that Babington, with her privity, defigned the death of Q.

Even ſo Madam, if Princes will murther their good ſubjects, their blind zeal is but a mad Frenzy, and to take the Sword from them, to bind their hands, and to caſt them into priſon, till they be brought to a ſober mind, is not diſobedience, but juſt obedience, becauſe it agrees with the word of God;</q> the Queen ſtood ſtill as one amazed for about a quarter of an hour, and changed her countenance at this bold ſpeech. When King James came to the Crown of England, the Preſbyterians defired the relaxation of ſome of the controverted ceremonies in the Church; upon which he appointed a Conſerence at Hampton Court between ſome of them and the Biſhops, where the K. diſcovered ſo much earneſtneſs againſt the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, &amp; ſuch Zeal for not allowing any abatements or alterations either in the Common Prayer, or Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Diſcipline, that Archbiſhop Whitgift iſaid, he was verily perſwaded that the King ſpake by the ſpirit of God; ſo that either the change of the air, or clearer information occaſioned a very extraordinary alteration of his ſentiments in theſe matters.</p>

After this the Earls of Huntley and Murray quarrelling, Earl Murray was miſerably ſlain; Bothwel then contrives new deſigns, and ſeizes the K. at Holy Rood Houſe, and forces him to ſign his pardon, to reſtore him all formerly poſſeſſed by him, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Chancellor, L.

Bothwel again raiſes a Rebellion with the aſſiſtance of the Popiſh Lords, but being diſcomfited, he flies into France, and thence to Naples, where he died poor and miſerable.</p>
            <p>In 1600 Charles his Son and ſucceſſor was born at Dumferling in Scotland, Nov. 19. and was ſo named in relation to the Duke of Lennox the King's Uncle. About the ſame time a Conſpiracy was reported to have been made by Earl Gowry, ſon of him aforementioned, againſt the Kings life, but he was killed by the Guards; March 26. 1603. King James had news that Queen Elizabeth was dead, and had declared him ſucceſſor, contrary to the opinion of many of the Scortiſh Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who being wearied with the tediouſneſs of their expectation, did believe at laſt it would never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Lords of England that the Queen was dead ſo long as there was any old Woman alive in England to wear good Cloaths, and take the name of Q. upon her; this was ſeconded with the advice of the Kings being Proclaimed her lawful ſucceſſor, whereupon he prepared himſelf for England, the late Queens Favourites being ready to receive him, and adore the riſing Sun; of whch toward her latter end they gave ſignal intimations, for her Courtiers would ſometimes in her preſence glance at the King of the Scots as her ſucceſſor (though they knew it would put her into a paſſion to ſpeak of a ſucceſſor) and ſhe would tell them; <q>Was this imputed to the Earl of Eſſex for a crime, and is it leſs in you?</q> Yea Secretary Cecil himſelf kept a correſpondence with King James, which he was once like to have been intrapt in; for the Queen tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the air upon Black heath hear Greenwich, a Poſt from Scotland came, whereupon ſhe ſtai'd her Coach to receive the Pacquer, but the Secretary being in the Coach with her, fearful that his Intrigues would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,

In his way to London the King was treated and applauded in ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a manner by the Engliſh Nobility and Gentry, that a Scotch Gentleman ſaid publickly, Theſe people will ſpoil a good King. May 11 1603. he arrived at Whitchall in the thirty ſixth year both of his age and Reign in Scotland, the Queen and Prince Henry fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a few weeks after, and in July the King and Q. were Crowned at Weſtminſter.</p>
            <p>In March following a Parliament was ſummoned, to whom the King, in a long ſpeech, earneſtly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Union of Scotland with England, ſince in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who deſcended lineally from King Henry ſeventh, The Union of the two Houſes of Lancaſter and York was reunited and confirmed, and declared the many advantages that from thence would redound to both Kingdoms. But the Engliſh ſtumbled at this Partition, thinking it an unequal diviſion, and fearing the Scots creeping into Engliſh Lordſhips and Engliſh Ladies beds, in both which they already began to be active, and likewiſe finding that the Kings boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty contracted it ſelf into private Favourites, beſtowing the affection he promiſed whole people upon one man, as afterwards on Somerſet &amp; Bueking ham, they doubted that Scotland though the leaſt, might, yet be the moſt predominant part; However in perſuance of this project, He is Proclaimed King of Great Brittain, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land muſt no more be a name, the Scotiſh Coyns are made currant, and our ſhips muſt have St. Georges and St. Andrews Croſſes quartered together in their Fings; with all outward ſigns of Amity; But although thoſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:172233:84"/>Engliſh Gentlemen that had not taſted of the Kings bounty repined to ſee the Scots advanced from their blue Bonnets to coſtly Bevers, as the Satyrical Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poons of that Age ſufficiently demonſtrated, yet the King guided the Helm of State ſo politiekly that theſe ſmall Guſts were not felt; The Parliament, to ſatisfy the Kings deſires about the Union, made an Act to authorize certain Commiſſioners to meet, Treat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with others nominated by the Parliament of Scotland, concerning ſuch matters as they ſhould think neceſſary for the honour of the K. &amp; common good of both Kingdoms; but the good intentions of this Union took no effect.</p>
            <p>1605 The horrible Powder Treaſon of the Papiſts againſt the King and Parliament was happily diſcovered to the Confuſion of the Conſpirators. In 1610 King Henry the fourth, Sirnamed the Great, of France (in the height of his Glory, having prepared a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Army and a vaſt Maſs of Treaſure, the intent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was kept very ſecret) received his deaths wound in his Caroch in one of the ſtreets of Paris by a poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dagger from the bloody hand of Ravilliac who was thought to be incited thereto by the Jeſuits, that were not aſſured of that Kings thorough converſion (as they called it) to the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>In 1612 Prince Henry died, &amp; there was a diſcourſe that he was poyſoned by a Bunch of Grapes, or by the venomous ſcent of a pair of Gloves, but the Phyſicians gave it under their hands that he dyed of a ſtrong malignant Feaver. In 1617 the King after 14 years abſence-went into Scotland; March 27 1625 King James died at Theobates in the 59 year of Age, and the 22 of his Reign in England, and was buried at Weſtminiſter.</p>
            <p n="69">LXIX. Charles his only Son and Heir ſuccee led him, and in 1633. being the Ninth year of his reign,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:172233:84"/>made a Journey into Scotland, and was Solemnly Crowned King at Edenburgh, though he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have avoided the trouble of going thither; for he writ to a Scotiſh Lord who was intruſted with that Crown to bring it into England, that the Geremony might have been performed here, but the Lord return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anſwer; That he durſt not be ſo falſe to his truſt, yet if his Majeſty would be pleaſed to accept thereof in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Scotch Parliament were now ſitting, and that Nation diſcovered great diſcontent at the paſſing of ſeveral Acts there; and the generality of the People would not ſuffer the Biſhop of Dumblain Dean of the Kings private Chappel there, to read the Common Prayer, neither durſt they receive the Communion on their knees, nor wear a Surplice. In 1637 the King deſigning a Uniformity of Church Government in both Kingdoms ſent them a Book of Common Prayer, or Liturgy, with an expreſs command that they ſhould read it in Churches; of which the Scotch complained, as not being allowed in their Church in a National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, that it was not the Same with that in England, but much altered in many places for the worſt, the variations approaching directly to the Roman Miſſal, and that all the parts of Popery were there; The King publiſht a Declaration to excuſe it, alledging, That it was not rendred them in the ſame words with the Engliſh, leſt they ſhould miſconſtrue it as a budg of dependancy of that Church upon this, and that the alterations were inſenſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this did not ſatisfy, ſo that when the Book was read by the Kings Command in the great Kirk at Edenburgh, a great uproar happened, in which the Biſhop that read it hardly eſcaped, and the Nobility and miniſters joyning with the Plebeians, a petition was ſent for recalling the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:172233:85"/>order, but the King was immoveable, and ſent another peremptory order for reading it, commanding all Petitioners to depart from Edenburgh, and that the Council ſhould receive no more Petitions; and whereas the Biſhops were charged as the cauſe of this iunovation, the King by Proclamation declared, that the Biſhops were wrougfully accuſed about the Prayer Book, that he himſelf was the Author of it, and all done by his command; He condemned their proceedings as Tumultuous, and denounced them Traytors who perſiſt therein.</p>
            <p>Againſt this Proclamation the Lords of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion proteſted, and entred into a Solemn League and Covenant, which was ſubſcribed by the Nobles, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and all ſorts of men; at which the King was iuraged and condemned the Covenant, but at length was perſwaded not to preſs the reading of the Book, Nov. 1. a National Synod is called at Glaſgow, out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeven days it was diſſolved by the Marquis of Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton as Commiſſioner; the Clergy proteſted againſt this Diſſolution, and continued to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>April 13. following a Parliament was called in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with whom the King was urgent to raiſe money for a war with Scotland, but they de monſtrating ſome averſneſs to that War, were diſſolved May 5. following; to the great regret of the generality of the people, there having none been called for 11. years before; The War with Scotland now proceeded vigorouſly, the Earl of Stafford being General, and ſome ſkirmiſhes happened near Berwick; But divers of the Engliſh Nobility being unſatisfied with the preſent proceedings, Petitioned the King to call another Parliament in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to redreſs the Greivances of the Kingdoms who wanting Money, was obliged to comply with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and in the mean time a Ceſſation of Arms was concluded for two Months, during which the Scors were to be paid 850. a day, or otherwiſe to raiſe it in the Northern Counties; The Parliament met at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter November 3. 1640. and diſcovered much kindneſs to the Scots, whom they judged the inſtruments of their meeting, and though the King had declated them Rebels, and deſired they might be driven out of the Kingdom; yet the Parliament continued the Ceſſation, and ordered, That they ſhould be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for all their charges and loſſes that this miſchievous War had brought upon them; That the Scotch ſhips taken ſince the War ſhould be reſtored, and 4000. pound payed to newrig them; That the full ſum of three hundred thouſand Pounds ſhould be given them toward a ſupply of the neceſſities of their brethren of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:172233:86"/>Scotland; The Scors Commiſſioners at London gave thanks to both houſes not only for the money, but for the kind Title of Brethren, and all Books Libels and Proclaimations againſt the Scots were voted to be called in, and a Thanksgiving was appointed, for the happy Peace, and both Armies were to be inſtantly diſbanded.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings ſtill more incenſed the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scots, and in Auguſt 1641. he reſolved to take a Journey into Scotland, though earneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In 1642.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:172233:87"/>between the King and Montroſs that the firſt ſhould march Northward, and the other South to join and make a conſiderable Army in thoſe parts, the K<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endeavoured to do it with a good body of Horſe but was prevented by the Parliaments Forces; yet Montroſs mindful of his promiſe, broke out into the South parts of Scotland with greater ſucceſs then could have been expected, having ſcarce 4000. Highlanders and Iriſh, and at a place near Kilſithe the Scotch Army fell into one of his Ambuſcades among the craggy rocks and ſtrait paſſages, and were cut off with a miſerable ſlaughter above 5000. being ſlain, and none eſcaped al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt but whom the wearied Conquerors had not time to kill, Montroſs ſparing none ſaying, They had no need of priſoners; The Covenanters had no Army for a Reſerve, or Forces to ſtop the Victor, to whom almoſt all the Towns preſently yielded, and his numbers daily increaſed.

            <p>Neither had the Kings affairs better ſucceſs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Parliaments Forces having by many field battles and gaining of Towns, vanquiſht his Army in moſt Countries; ſome few Garriſons only defended themſelves, and among them the ſtrongeſt was New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warck, which was ſtraitly beſeiged by General Leven, Pointz and Roffiter; but though the Plague raged in the Town, and they began to want proviſion, yet they held out in hopes of advantage from the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the Scotch Army, who commplained of the neglect of Church Government, and the Covenant, and for want of pay though they had received above two
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:172233:87"/>hundred thouſand pound in two years, beſides great ſums extorted from the Northern Countries;</p>
            <p>The King hearing of theſe diſſenters, reſolved if poſſible to ſerve himſelf of them, and therefore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately went out of Oxford, and came to the Scotch Camp at Southwell, May 5. 1646. The Scots ſeemed amazed at his coming, and gave notice of it to the Engliſh Commiſſioners there preſent, they ſent the news to Parliament, who required them to detain the King at Southwell, but they contrary to that order car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away with them Northward to Newcaſtle; The Scots excuſed their departure, Newark being yielded to the Engliſh by the Kings order, and that no work was left for them, That as the King came to them of his own accord unexpected, ſo he followed their Army, neither being intreated nor forbidden by them.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Parliament voted, That the perſon of the King ſhould be diſpoſed of by both Houſes of Parliament. Which cauſed great heats between the two Nations, but at length the Scots agreed to deliver up Berwick, Carliſle and Newcaſtle upon the receiving of four hundred thouſand pound, and the King was delivered into the hands of the Engliſh Commiſſioners, and brought by them with great obſervance and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable attendance to his Palace at Holmby in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptonſhire, and the Scotch Army marched home again; But June 4. 1647. he was taken away from thence out of the hands of the Parliament Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by a Party of the Engliſh Army, and brought by his own deſire to Newmarket, and from thence to Hampton Court, and ſoon after the Parliament paſs a vote, That they would make no further Addreſs to the King; Who had a while before privatly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf to the Iſle of Wight, and from thence had ſent to the Parliament, that he might be admitted to Treat perſonally at London; the Commiſſioners of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:172233:88"/>Scotland with great, vehemence preſſing that it might be granted.</p>
            <p>The Kings Friends were ſo exaſperated with theſe Votes that ſeveral Inſurrections were made at the ſame time in divers parts of England, ſo that the King this Summer 1648. though ſet aſide and confined to the Iſle of Wight ſeemed more formidable than when he was followed by the ſtrongeſt Armys; but the greateſt danger that threatened the Parliament was from the North, and Scotland, for Duke Hammilton in July with a numerous Army of Scots entred England, and by joining ſome Engliſh Forces became 25000, ſtrong; but Cromwell and Lambert though much inferior, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ten thouſand, Auguſt 20. ingaged them near Preſton in Lancaſhire, and entirely routed them, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 3000. and taking 9000. Priſoners, purſuing them above 20 miles; Duke Hammilton was taken with about 3000. Horſe, and being brought to London was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Weſtminſter; this was the Succeſs of D. Hamiltons invading England.</p>
            <p>Cromwell following his Victory, entred into Scotland to help Argile, and Leven, againſt the Forces of Monroe and Lanerick, whom he ſoon reduced, and was honourably entertained at Edenburgh by order of the Committee of Eſtates, and thanks were given him by Miniſters, whom they Styled the preſerver of Scotland under God; after which all the Forces there were diſbanded, except 1500 under the Command of Leven, and the Eſtates and Kirk decreed, That for preſervation of Religion and brotherly amity with the Engliſh Nation, no man which had joined with Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in the late Invaſion of England ſhould be choſen into the New Parliament, or the Aſſembly of the Kirk; Though the year before theſe very Scots had declared the Engliſh Army to be a bundle of Sectarys or Rebels for acting the very ſame thing in England which they now did in Scotland</p>

The Parliament of Scotland having notice of this fatal ſtroke; Feb. 3. following they proclaimed Charles his Son King at Edenburgh, and then ſent Commiſſioners to Treat with him at Breda, whither he was come from Jerſey to that purpoſe, where it was concluded, that the King ſhould ſign the ſolemn League and Covenant, and paſs an Act for all Perſons to take it throughout the Kingdom, that he ſhould withdraw his Commiſſions from Montroſs and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Papiſts from about him; with ſeveral other particulars; During which Treaty Montroſs was
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:172233:89"/>ſeized in Scotland for oppoſing the Kirk Party, and condemned and executed upon a Gibbet near 50 foot high, with all imaginable contempt, which had like to have broke off the Treaty if the neceſſity of the Kings affairs would have permitted it.</p>
            <p>July 15. 1650. the K. arrived at Edenburgh and was again proclaimed there, but his Coronation was defer'd becauſe Cromwell with the Engliſh Army, was upon the Borders, whom the Scots under the Command of Mountgomery fell upon with great advantage at Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelborough, but were wholly defeated by them at Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar; Jan. 1. following, the King. was ſolemnly Crowned at St. Johnſton, and reſolved to be Generaliſſimo of his Army, and fortified Sterling; but Cromwell perceiving he could not draw the Scots to a Field battel, ſuddenly, tranſported over Fyfe 1600. foot and 4. Troops of Horſe, who routed the Forces under Sr. John Brown, taking him and ſeveral others Priſoners, and killing 2000 on the place; The King ſeeing the Engliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo faſt in Scotland reſolved to quit it, and marcht for England, which he did July 30. 1651. which Cromwell obſerving ſent Lambert after him with a ſelect Party of Horſe; At length the King arrived at Worceſter and fortified it, but was ſoon befieged there by the numerous Forces of the Parliament; who obliged him to quit the Town, and fally out with his Forces upon Cromwells Army, by whom they were in a ſhort time utterly defeated, the King making his eſcape, and getting into France; About 3000 were ſlain, and 700 taken Priſoners.</p>
            <p>After this the Engliſh took moſt of the ſtrong Towns, Forts and Caſtles in the Lowlands, but the Highlanders made invaſions upon them yet were at length totally defeated by General Monk and Collonel Morgan, who likewiſe diſſolved the Aſſembly of the Kirk, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Preſbyterian Clergy; things continued quiet in Scotland during the Protectorates of Oliver and Richard Cromwell, but the Army under Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,

            <p>But though the Scots and Engliſh Preſbiterians were principally inſtrumental in the reſtoration of King Charles 2. yet this ſignal ſervice was ſoon forgotten; and ſevere Acts of Parliament were made in both Kingdoms againſt them, which occaſioned much diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in both Nations, eſpecially in Scotland, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an invincible averſion to Prelacy could not endure the thoughts of its being again impoſed upon them, but made ſeveral inſurections, whereby many of them were cut off; ſo that by the influence of evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors (as his preſent Majeſty when Prince of Orange in his declaration to the Kingdom of Scotland then publiſhed) the lives, honours and Eſtates of the Scots were deſigued to have been raviſhed from them, and the whole reign of K.

                  <hi>A Deſcription of the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland.</head>
               <p>THis Ancient Kingdom is divided from England by the Rivers Tweed and Solway, the Cheviot Hills reaching from one River to the other on the South; It hath the German Ocean on the Eaſt; on the North the Iſles of Orkney, and the Deucalidonian Sea; and the Kingdom of Ireland on the Weſt; it is a fair and ſpacious Countrey 480 Miles in length, but in breadth far leſs, no place being 60 miles from the Sea; The air is ſharp and cold, it hath Rivers, Woods, mountains, and low grounds which produce ſuch plenty of Fiſh, Foul, Cattle and Corn, that it ſuplies the wants of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries.</p>
               <p>The People are generally well ſhaped, ſtrong of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, high minded, and ſo valiant in War that there are few Countries where they were not imployed in Military affairs. The Nobility and Gentry are great affecters of Learning, and dont only frequent their own Univerſities but travel into forreign parts for improvem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The whole Kingdom is divided into two parts the Lowlands and the Highlands, wherein are 34 ſhires or Counties; the Regal City thereof is Edenburgh ſeated in Lothian where is the Royal Palace; It conſiſts principally of one ſtreet about a Mile long, into which run many lanes, ſo that the whole Compaſs may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three miles; it is fortified by a Caſtle that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Town; the South part of Scotland is more populous and rich, as well as more civiliz'd in manners; The North or Highland inhabitants are more under retaining the cuſtoms of the Wild Iriſh.</p>
               <p>This Kingdom was once inhabited by two populous Nations, the Scots and Picts; but the Highland men, the natural Scots indeed are ſuppoſed to deſcend from the Scythians, who with the Getoe invading Ireland left their poſterity behind them, and at length the word Scyth
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:172233:91"/>degenerated in Scot, and Scythland into Scotland; though ſome derive the name from Scota the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Pharaoh that ſaved Moſes in the river;</p>
               <p>The Piets are thought to be the Brittains who fled out of Britrain from the Roman ſervitude, and ſetled themſelves here, till after long Wars, the Scors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing they utterly extermined not only the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but the name of Picts. Scotland is far more Barren than England, the chief commodites are Liance Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">II. Another memorable matter is the Soland Geeſe, which are moſt plentiful about the Baſs near Edenburgh, and are in ſuch great numbers that they ſometimes ſeem to darken the Air. There have been great diſputes among the Learned about the generation of them, ſome aſſerting that they were bred of moiſt rotten Wood, lying in the Water; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they come of an Egg and are hatched like all other Geeſe; But many Scots men do aſſert, that they really grow upon a Tree called the Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale
